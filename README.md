# Курс «Моделирование пожара»
Лекции и упражнения по моделированию пожара

## Веб-страница сборки
https://romanmironenko.github.io/LectureFireSimulation_RU

## Местная разработка

*Примечение: The following explicit commands are for bash / zsh on Linux / MacOS.*

### 1. Clone repository
```
git clone https://github.com/FireDynamics/LectureFireSimulation.git
```
### 2. Inside the repository, setup a virtual environment for Python
```
python -m venv .venv
```
### 3. Activate the virtual environment
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Requirements for different systems, see [link](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):

| Platform | Shell           | Command to activate virtual environment|
| -------- |:---------------:| -------------------------------------- |
| POSIX    | bash/zsh        | $ source <venv>/bin/activate           |
|          | fish            |   $ source <venv>/bin/activate.fish    |
|          | csh/tcsh        |    $ source <venv>/bin/activate.csh    |
|          | PowerShell Core |    $ <venv>/bin/Activate.ps1           |
| Windows  | cmd.exe         |    C:\> <venv>\Scripts\activate.bat    |
|          | PowerShell      |    PS C:\> <venv>\Scripts\Activate.ps1 |

Note: In Windows PowerShell there is a restriction to run scripts. If the Execution Policy is not changed it will raise a message like "cannot be loaded because the execution of scripts is disabled on this system". One can allow the execution of scripts for the active PowerShell session by `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process`, see [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18713086/virtualenv-wont-activate-on-windows).

### 4. Install the required Python packages, needed only once
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 5. Launch JupyterLab
```
jupyter-lab
```
### 6. Do some editing. The contents of the book are stored in the `content` folder.
### 7. Build a local version of the book
```
cd book
jupyter-book build .
```
Note: Some notebooks are capable to turn the output of matplotlib figures on and off based on the environment variable JB_NOSHOW. It should be set (to any value) to prevent the rendering of dublicate figures, e.g.:

```
cd book
JB_NOSHOW=1 jupyter-book build .
```

### 8. If the build is sucessful, the location of the build book is stated. You can open it with a browser.

## Data Repository

The simulation input files as well as the resulting simulation data is stored in the `data` folder.

### Execution of Simulations

In all data subfolders, FDS input files as well as a run script `case_run.sh` is located. You may have to adjust the execution command of FDS at the top of the script.

### Download Precomputed Data

The `case_download.sh` script inside the individual data subfolders can be used to download precomputed data.

## Contribution

### For external

Please for the `development` branch and create a pull request based on that.

### For internal

**New section / content**: Create a feature branch of `development`. Once finished, merge it back and create a release branch with your changes that have to be pushed to `main`. Assign Lukas as reviewer for the pull request.

**Typos / Fixes**: Push them directly to the `development` branch and then directly to `main`.
